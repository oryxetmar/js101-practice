- i am very slow to learn this, clearly
- i really wanted to figure out how to turn my string on sushi into a boolean so that when variables were changed it would be a false statemnt. but i need to do that outside of this assign as im already so late
- i feel incredibly unsure about structure of this assignment and i wasnt sure what the html and css needed to be or if that wasnt necessary. 
- i spent a lot of time using youtube video
